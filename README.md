<h1>College-Admission-usingR</h1>

<h2>Business Scenario:</h2>

Every year thousands of applications are being submitted by international students for admission in colleges of the USA. It becomes an iterative task for the Education Department to know the total number of applications received and then compare that data with the total number of applications successfully accepted and visas processed. Hence to make the entire process easy, the education department in the US analyze the factors that influence the admission of a student into colleges.

<h2>Goals:</h2>
Analyze the historical data and determine the key drivers for admission in colleges of the USA

<h2>Analysis:</h2>
1. Logistic regression model
   Accuracy with logistic regression model is 69 % with AUC 0.54
   
2. Decision tree model
   Accuracy of decision tree model is 64%
   
3. Support Vector Machine model
   Accuracy with SVM is 69%

<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
On college admission dataset champion model can be either Logistic regression or SVM with same accuracy further there is a scope to tune in parameters of each model for better accuracy.
